### shell-plugin

>I'm running a CTF competition that is geared towards newer students. I know that most of the students don't have easy access to a linux machine so why not give students shell access to my server so that they can use it to solve challenges?

>In order to make this a reality I wrote this cool plugin for CTFd to automatically create an account when they register for the competition.
One of the students claims that they can get a root shell on my server though. Can you figure out what happened and fix the issue for me?
