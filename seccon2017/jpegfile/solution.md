### JPEF File

The image is of a grey rectangle.  As the image opens fine and doesnt look corrupt it looks like there is a missing section of data.

Looking at the jpeg spec each segment starts with 0xFF and when there is a 0xFF in the data segment it needs to be followed with 0x00.

Using a hex editor I searched for all instances of FF and check that the following byte was either a correct jpeg marker or 0x00.

At offset 0x26f is a marker that is 0xFF0xFC which is not valid.

The previous marker is a 'Start of Scan' (0xFF0xDA) and the one following is a piece of data (0xFF0x00) so this look like it should be data aswell.

Changing the byte 0xFC to 0x00 and saving the file makes the flag visible.
