### JPEF File

The image is of a grey rectangle.  As the image opens fine and doesnt look corrupt it looks like there is a missing section of data.

Looking at the jpeg spec each segment starts with 0xFF and if there is any 0xFF in the data segment it needs to be terminated with 0x00.

Using a hex editor I searched for all instances of FF and check that the following byte was either a correct jpeg marker or 0x00.

At 0x26f in the file is a marker that is 0xFF0xFC which is not valid.

The previous marker is a 'Start of Scan' and the one following is a data byte so this look like it should be data aswell.

Changing the byte 0xFC to 0x00 and saving the file makes the flag visible.
